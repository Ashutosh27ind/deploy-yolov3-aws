This repository contains code for YOLO v3 Object detection and hosting the same on AWS     
   
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazonâ€™s cloud web hosting platform offering compute power, storage, database, migration and lot many other functionalities 
that helps in building scalable, reliable, flexible and cost-effective solutions.  
  
We deploy a YOLOV3 object identification model with 80 output classes.  
    
So the various steps involved in deploying a model to AWS are as follows:  
   
Train a Machine Learning Model 
Serialize the ML Model  
Create an AWS account  
Launch a micro instance on AWS  
Connect to AWS instance  
Move the files to an AWS-EC2 instance  
Install the requirements file in the instance
